<h2 class="center">Law Attorney</h2>
<div class="content center">This was my first freelance project. Law Attorney was a new firm started a few years ago. To get them on the map I helped them develope their web site. I got content from the owner and togehter with some employees we discussed the purpose of the website and how they wanted the design.
</br>
Since the Law Attorney was very new I helped them from scratch with designing their logo and so on.
