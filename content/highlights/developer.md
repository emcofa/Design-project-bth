<h2 class="center">Jerry Swift</h2>
<div class="content center">Jerry Swift was a customer I helped design his website to promote his project, just like my page. He is also a web developer but not specified within the same design as I am. Therefor I got a lot of experience by working with him since I could learn him new stuff and he could also learn me.
