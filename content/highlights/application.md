<h2 class="center">My application</h2>
<div class="content center">Together with my friend, also a freelancer (more specified within mobile app development), we are launching an app next year with focus on sustainable development. We want to reduce consumption by make it possible for private persons by lending out their things with an amount of money as an exchange. These things can for example be tools, clothes, bikes and so on. By doing that a person doesn't need to by an expensive hammer drill when they are going to put up a painting on the wall or don't have to by a new dress for a party if they can borrow one more cheap from another person. This will hopefully lead to less consumption and a great impact on the environment.
