<p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Emmie and I have a enormous passion about creating things.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid and went to kindergarten and school I could sit for hours all by myself and apply perler beads to my pegboard or make clay figures. When I became a little bit older and had to make a presentation in school, the funniest thing I new was to make an epic PowerPoint presentation with a cool style. I also had an era a few years ago when I was 110% sure I wanted to be a photographer and a year later my passion for gardening began to grow. I can not say that I was very good at those things in the beginning but the interest in creating new things always learned me to develope myself. My passion for computers have always been there though. I do not have much experience in web design at all (nothing to be precisely) but the idea of working with colors and different forms of design at the same time in a computer sounds too tempting to not try. Hopefully learn programming and web design will lead to my dream job,m, because I have that feeling now.</p>
